Hi. My name's Kyle. I'm a high school senior. I use GitHub sometimes. Actually, I use it quite a lot. I program things in C# sometimes, but I'm familiar with other languages as well (C++, Java, Python, and F# specifically). You'll find that I'm quite scatterminded when it comes to pet projects. For a while I was working on a multi-purpose math library for .NET 6 and 7 called [Nerd_STF](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/Nerd_STF) with more than 4 thousand downloads on [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nerd_STF)), then it was a Source Engine command-line tool called [SrcMod](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/SrcMod) that went pretty well for a while. Then it was a [programmable graphing calculator](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/Graphing) I made for Windows Forms, and now I'm working on several things: a rework of that original mathematics library, a peer-to-peer chat room, and a programming language. That last one is still in a very early form and I won't be revealing anything about it for a while, stay tuned for that one.

I don't play a whole lot of games, they're just not my thing, but my favorites have got to be Portal 2 (and its mods), Not For Broadcast, and Death Stranding, in that order. I've had a few game ideas, but you likely won't see anything about them for a very long time, because research is dominant and that kind of thing takes a long time to get right when you're just one guy.

I've got a website, [thatonenerd.net](https://thatonenerd.net/), but I haven't updated it in a while. Web development is not my thing, and I will always resist using an external framework to do things I could do myself (even if it's done worse). The current website utilizes no website builders or frameworks, and if I make a new one, that principle will remain. I much prefer desktop applications, mostly .NET, as either console projects or UI projects.

I've got a whole lot of project ideas that are spur-of-the-moment, but I don't usually publish the GitHub repository associated, because I don't want to publish something that dies very quickly. At least with the other projects I've mentioned, they lasted for several months to years before eventually being dropped (scope creep is quite a killer in this regard). But I do have a [repository](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/ComputerStudiesProjects) with small, week-long projects I've made for my computer studies class. The topics are chosen by me, and I do all the work, it's just considered an assignment for the class.

I fully support the Internet Archive's goals and achievements.

Anyway, feel free to send me spam mail or anything else you'd like at [kyle@thatonenerd.net](mailto:kyle@thatonenerd.net). I know it's a different email than the one on my bio, but this one looks neater and is just an alias to the old one. It doesn't matter which one you use. Or you could not send me emails. It doesn't matter to me. I'm done here. Check out some stuff if you'd like.

Cave Johnson, we're done here.
