Hi, I'm Kyle. I'm a freshman at the Rochester Institute of Technology, class of 2029. I use GitHub sometimes. Actually, I use it quite a lot. I'm familiar with a variety of languages (C++, Java, and branching into Zig among others), but C# is typically my go-to. You'll find I'm quite scatterminded when it comes to personal projects. I'm working on a general-purpose library for .NET called [Nerd_STF](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/Nerd_STF), it's go over five thousand downloads on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nerd_STF))! I've also written a [programmable graphing calculator](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/Graphing) using Windows Forms, and I've done a whole lot of other projects for my computer studies class last year, which you can find [here](https://github.com/That-One-Nerd/ComputerStudiesProjects).

I typically tend to thrive in backend or desktop-targeted environments when I can go my own pace. I have a very strong sense of perfectionism, and I would rather take a very long time to release a good product than rush and release a crappy one. So most of my repositories are private, and I think that's alright. I churn through the ones I like, and even if I give up on a project (scope creep is quite a killer in that regard), I come out the other side knowing more than when I started. That's what matters to me.

I occasionally play games. At the moment, my favorites are Pizza Tower, Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and Cuphead, though this stuff changes over time. Portal 2 has been the best game I've ever played in terms of story and immersion, though, it's been in that number one slot for years. But you know, there's a difference between your "overall most favorite game" and your "favorite game right now."

I like to reinvent the wheel. Usually, this means using absolutely no external libraries in my projects. It all comes down to that intrinsic feeling of learning new things. I'd rather learn how something works and re-implement it than take it for granted. That can prove to be curse sometimes, because often building up the requisites to the thing I want to make takes considerably more time than the thing itself. But, to me at least, it feels better knowing that the foundations were built by yourself.

In the future, these are some things that I'd love to learn about and get good at (in no particular order):
- Computer Physics and Collisions
- Software Rasterization and GPU Programming
- Low-Level Understanding of Various Image and Video Formats
- Compiler Design
- Operating System Design

Anyway, that's that. You can always send me spam at [kyle@thatonenerd.net](mailto:kyle@thatonenerd.net). Or you could not, it's up to you. I'm done hinting at projects, because they almost never see the light of day in a reasonable timeframe. I'll keep making repositories though, so feel free to take a look.

Cave Johnson, we're done here.
