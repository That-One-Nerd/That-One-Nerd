# That_One_Nerd

Hey everyone! I'm Kyle, and I program games for a hobby. I'm currently working on Arcade Maniac as my main project, but I've got other hobbys too, like making a website and working on another, *secret* game.

I have a [Discord]() server that you can join if you feel like chilling. I release announcements and teasers there sometimes. I release my games on [Itch](https://that-one-nerd.itch.io).

Also, I wasn't kidding about the [website](https://thatonenerd.net).

Well, anyways, this is my github page. You get to see the bunch of projects that either didn't work out, or I stopped working on *cough cough* Nerd-STF, Nerd's Teaser Bot *cough cough*. But on the other hand, maybe you're here for Arcade Maniac, or other projects that I'm working on. Whatever the case, enjoy your stay!
